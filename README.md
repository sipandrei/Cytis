# Cytis
## A centralized tire inflation system for bicycles

## Summary 
  How many times have you been on a ride and forgot to check the tire pressure before hitting the road (or the trails) or you were changing the terrain and you haven't got that perfect pressure. Well this product helps to prevent you from getting in that situation by allowing you to control how much air you got in your tires directly from your phone, maybe in the future from your handlebars.
  
## What is Cytis made of 
  For a start I will be using an Arduino variant hooked up to an air pump connected with a hose to the air valve. The device will be mounted on the hub of the wheel in order to be less noticeable. It will probably run on a lipo battery.
  For the phone interface I will start off with a PWA(probably running on Rails - the only backend framework that I currently know :/ ) or an app in MIT app inventor, eventualy there will be an app.
  
## Main functions
 * Read the current air pressure
 * Inflate the tire
 * Deflate the tire
